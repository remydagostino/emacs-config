My own emacs config. We will grow old together.

### Notes ###

* C-l = reposition screen on cursor
* M-m = cursor to first non-whitespace character
* C-Shift-Backspace = kill-whole-line
* M-x switch-to-buffer = to create an empty buffer
* C-' = comment region
* C-s C-w = search at word
* C-u C-Space = Go to mark

### Todo
